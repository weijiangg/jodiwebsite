  		<p>Checking out RHA Enhancements is easy! Go to your Service Desk and request the specific item that you would like to check out, and if it is available, they will check it out to you using your One Card. You will receive an e-mail letting you know that you checked out the item and reminding you that it is due to the front desk within 48 hours (Some exceptions apply).

			Before checking out RHA Enhancements for the first time, please read the RHA Enhancements End User Agreement (available at your Service Desk.)
			
			All RHA Enhancements may be checked out for a maximum of 48 hours. If you return the item within 48 hours, everyone remains happy. However, if the item is returned late, the resident will be charged a dollar a day for up to 5 days. After the fifth day, the item will be marked lost and the resident with the item in his or her possession will be charged to replace the item, according to the pricing matrix. If there is an error in the system, or if you feel you have been wrongly charged you are given the option to appeal the charge (see below). You will have 48 hours to return the appeals form to the Service Desk, at which point the Community Manager and the Community Enhancement Officer will meet to decide on the appeal.
